# Welcome. In this kata, you are asked to square every digit of a number and concatenate them.
# For example, if we run 9119 through the function, 811181 will come out, because 92 is 81 and 12 is 1.
# Note: The function accepts an integer and returns an integer

# def square_digits(number):
#   num = str(number)
#   #print(num)
#   def square(n):
#     x = int(n)
#     return str(x * x)
#   new_num = map(square, list(num))
#   #  print(new_num)
#   result = "".join(new_num)
#   return int(result)

# print(square_digits(23))
